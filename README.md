## Coding style

### Pre-Commit
The Docker container comes with [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) installed.
pre-commit is a pre-commit framework which can be attached as git hook. It
runs code-formatting and other checks automatically before committing any code.
You just need to install with:

```bash
pre-commit install
pre-commit autoupdate
```
